**Special Note**

Most people don’t realize how predictable they are—until it’s too late. In 🌍 Africa, a staggering 95.6% of mobile money users rely on their birthdate as their PIN. In 🌏 Asia, it's 83.2%. 
In 🌎 North America, 86.9%. In 🌎 South America, it peaks at 90.1%, and in 🌍 Europe, 89.0% of people still use their birthday as a mobile app or banking PIN. 
This global pattern of carelessness has opened the door for attackers—and Ian The Ripper walks right through it. 🧨

🧠 Ian The Ripper is a precision tool built to exploit weak PIN habits. Think you're safe because you didn’t use your birthdate? Think again. 
It only takes 2,345 seconds (that’s less than ⏱️ 40 minutes) to crack a standard 4-digit PIN.

This isn’t just guessing—it’s intelligent ripping. It learns, calculates, and shreds through false security. 🔓 It’s not just another tool—it’s a digital predator hiding in plain sight. 🐍

I hope you find Ian The Ripper both powerful and enlightening. 💡

Enjoy the tool 😈—or become its next example.
Use wisely... or prepare to be ripped apart. 💥
